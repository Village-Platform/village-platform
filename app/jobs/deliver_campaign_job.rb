# Sends a campaign: one FCM message to its topics, then an inbox row per signed-in recipient.
#
# Idempotent. The job only proceeds while the campaign is scheduled (or sending, on a retry) and
# still scheduled for the time it was queued with, so a canceled or rescheduled campaign makes the
# old job a no-op. The FCM message name is saved right after the send and a retry that finds it
# skips the send. The one gap: a crash between FCM accepting the message and that save re-sends it
# on retry (at-least-once; FCM has no idempotency key). Inbox rows are deduplicated by dedupe_key.
