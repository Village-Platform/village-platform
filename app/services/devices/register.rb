module Devices
  # Upserts an app install by installation_id (stable) and stores its current FCM token (rotates).
  #
  # Ownership rules: an anonymous request cannot change a device that belongs to a user, otherwise
  # whoever learned an installation_id could swap in their own token and receive that user's pushes.
  # The exception is the install itself, which proves it by presenting the token already stored:
  # it may detach (an expired JWT, a deleted account, a logout whose detach call failed). A
  # signed-in request may claim a guest device, its own, or another user's (the same phone, a new
  # login): the previous user is detached first.
